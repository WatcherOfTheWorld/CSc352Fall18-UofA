Up to two points deducted for each of the programs in each category of
the first three categories. 
For each program, 0 is good, 1 is could be better, 2 means significant issues.
5 pts per program will be lost if the program included an scanf that didn't
protect against buffer overflow (or did it incorrectly)
5 pts per program will be lost for each unallowed function used unless a
harsher penalty is written in the program spec.
You must have used malloc or calloc to allocate the space for the array to
receive credit for problem 2.
